        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 16, 2025</p>

        <p>
          CBA Digital (“CBA Digital,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides operations and
          digital consulting services for small businesses. This Privacy Policy
          explains how we collect, use, and share information when you visit our
          website or otherwise interact with us.
        </p>

        <p>
          By using this website, you agree to the collection and use of information
          in accordance with this Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the
          site.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Information you choose to provide</h3>
        <p>
          When you interact with us, you may provide information such as your name,
          email address, business name and role, phone number, and any other details
          you include in a message or form. You typically provide this information
          when you submit the contact form, email us, or schedule a call.
        </p>

        <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
        <p>
          When you visit the website, basic technical information may be collected
          automatically, such as your IP address, browser type, device type,
          general location, and which pages you visit. This information is used in
          aggregate to understand how the site is used and to improve it.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Respond to inquiries and provide the services you request.</li>
          <li>Communicate with you about projects, scheduling, and next steps.</li>
          <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the website and our services.</li>
          <li>Keep internal records related to current and potential clients.</li>
          <li>Comply with legal obligations or protect our rights, where necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

        <h2>3. Legal Bases (EEA/UK Visitors)</h2>
        <p>
          If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom,
          we process your personal data based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contract</strong> – to respond to your request or perform a contract with you.</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to run and improve the business and communicate with you, where these interests are not outweighed by your rights.</li>
          <li><strong>Consent</strong> – where required by law; you may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>
          We may share information with service providers who help operate the
          website, manage communications, or store data (for example, email or
          hosting providers). These providers are given only the information needed
          to perform their work and are expected to protect it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also share information if required by law, to respond to legal
          requests, to protect the rights and safety of CBA Digital or others, or
          in connection with a business transaction such as a merger or transfer of
          assets.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We keep personal information for as long as reasonably necessary for the
          purposes described in this Policy, including to respond to your inquiry,
          maintain an active working relationship, or comply with legal and tax
          requirements. You may ask us to delete information about you using the
          contact details below.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
          protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
          disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or
          method of storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
          security.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on where you live, you may have rights regarding your personal
          information, such as the right to access, correct, or request deletion of
          your data, or to object to certain types of processing. You may also have
          the right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          To exercise these rights, contact us using the information below. We may
          need to verify your identity before responding. You may also have the
          right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Third‑Party Links</h2>
        <p>
          This website may link to other websites. We are not responsible for the
          privacy practices or content of those third‑party sites, and you should

        <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our website and services are intended for adults working in or on behalf
          of a business. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
          children under 18. If you believe a child has provided us with personal
          information, please contact us so we can delete it.
        </p>
