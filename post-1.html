        <p>There’s something powerful about deciding to finally start. I’ve waited longer than I should have, but in that time I’ve learned — about technology, about process, and about what it really means to turn ideas into tangible results. This isn’t just about business; it’s about rediscovering that drive to create, to lead, to bring something of value into the world.</p>

        <p>Entrepreneurship has always fascinated me. I’ve watched people take that leap — open a shop, launch a service, stake their livelihood on an idea — and I’ve always admired the courage it takes to bet on yourself. That’s the spirit that built communities like ours. It’s the heartbeat of every Main Street.</p>

        <p>For me, that Main Street is Oregon City. It’s a place where history meets possibility, where the old and new blend together. Every storefront tells part of a story, and together they create something much larger — a community of people who believe in their city and want to see it thrive. That’s the community I want to contribute to, not just as a resident but as someone who helps business owners build, improve, and succeed.</p>

        <p>My mission is simple: to help small businesses work smarter, grow stronger, and create lasting local impact. Through consulting, I aim to bridge the gap between ideas and execution — helping entrepreneurs use technology and sound processes to open doors, create opportunities, and strengthen their foundations. Whether it’s in Oregon City or beyond, I believe that small business is the engine of vitality in every community.</p>

        <p>This blog is where I’ll share what I learn along the way — lessons about growth, about building better systems, and about staying true to a mission. It’s also where I’ll celebrate the people who make communities like ours special: those who dream, start, and persist. Every town has a soul, and on Oregon City’s Main Street, that soul shines through its small business owners.</p>

        <p>This is the journey I’m choosing to document — not just building a business, but helping others do the same. One step, one conversation, one idea at a time.</p>
